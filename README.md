# Projective Geometry Estimation Exercises

## 1. Single view metrology

### Usage
1. Annotate the image

Change the variable **annotations_filename** at the beginning of **annotate.py**, then run:

```python
cd single_view_metrology
python annotate.py images/img2.jpeg
```

Then select full screen and start taking two points for the reference (Davide), two points for the measure and two couple of points for each couple of parallel lines.

2. Measure the unknown distance (*measure*)

Run a copy of **main.ipynb** changing the source of variable **img**.

### TODO
- [x] Take the image for the first exercise
- [x] Use relevant class notebooks (E2B)
- [ ] Draft a report on Overleaf (to be backed up here)
- [x] Implement the exercises in Python

## 2. Eight point algorithm
